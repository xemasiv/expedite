Self-orchestrating p2p delivery network using WebRTC

## Project Goals

My goal here is to create an open-source approach in maximizing the current availability of WebRTC into optimizing our existing network architectures.

The gist is, Cloud Delivery Networks (CDN's) are indeed available and affordable right now - but that's the server-side of things being optimized. This project aims to address the client-side of things where we can leverage the prominent rise of WebRTC with other existing technologies, e.g. encoding, compression & cache's.

That's pretty much it: encoding, compression & cache **plus** WebRTC, all to optimize the way we receive images, videos, etc.

## Why is it possible now

(aka the non-statistical motivating presumptions)

#### Moore's law

* We now got more and more devices in the market with higher compute capability. Processing power is one, processing stamina is another: pretty much everyone nowadays have their own almighty power bank.

#### Increasing internet penetration & connectivity

* This means pursuits like this can also benefit end-user experiences in developing countries.

#### Increasing internet bandwidth quality

* DSL's are continuously being replaced with Fiber, and 4g with 5g in the future.

#### WebRTC

* We can now establish direct connections with each other. We can do this not only on our desktop/laptop but also in our mobile phones nowadays.

#### Web Workers

* Encoding / compression tasks can be handled by web worker threads which doesn't interfere with the main (aka user interface) thread.

#### Rise of SPA's

* Great websites use good frameworks. These frameworks like React/Vue allows us to navigate web apps without refreshing the page. Not refreshing the page means existing WebRTC connections won't come to waste and can be maximized to full utility.

#### Smarter Web API's

* We can detect pretty much everything nowadays, ie. if you're running on a battery (laptop / mobile), or if you're running in a good WebRTC-worthy connection (4g & up). Basic device information like these allows us to create better (or more appropriately, smarter) modules.

#### tl;dr

* This is it man, welcome to the future.

## Glossary / Terms

#### Fugitive Server

A server-side script whose purpose is to route signals between client instances, in order for them to establish WebRTC connections with each other. We are currently using `uws` for the WebSocket server instance.

#### Fugitive Client

A client-side script whose purpose is to establish WebRTC connection with other end-users, and to query & verify resources from these peers. We are currently using `simple-peer` for our WebRTC connection instances.

#### Fugitive Fetch

This is our drop-in replacement for `fetch`. We are using `yetch` from Netflix since it already comes with `AbortController`.

#### Tier-1 Peers

These are client instances of other end users..

1. Which have existing WebRTC connections with you

#### Tier-2 Peers

These are client instances of other end users..

1. Which are not connected to you
2. But has existing WebRTC connections with your Tier-1 Peers

* Response chunking by `16 * 1024` bytes ![done](/i/chk.png)
* SHA 224 hash verification
* *Integer* `min_target_peer_count` config option
* *Integer* `max_target_peer_count` config option
* Peer checks on websocket connect
* Peer checks on peer connect & disconnect
* *Boolean* `disconnect_websocket_on_max` config option
* Exponential back-off mechanism on reconnection attempts
* Passive resource reservation (w/ Tier-1 + Tier-2 peers)
* Peer locking & unlocking between transfers
* Passive latency checking & peer-eviction
* Checking if content is worth keeping as compressed or not
* Transfer indicator if content is compressed or not
* Disable on low battery?
* Decrease limits on mobile devices?
* Disable when window is inactive? (Page Visibility API)
* Disable when using 4g internet? (Network Information API)
* Allow high-precision mode for clients? (Geolocation API)

#### Fugitive Fetch

* Simulated multicast (multiple unicast) ![done](/i/chk.png)
* In-memory caching, with `quick-lru` ![done](/i/chk.png)
* De-coupling of content-type from input / output
* IndexedDB persistent storage

#### Web Assets Loading Examples

* JS / CSS Scripts
* Fonts
* Images (jpg / png / svg / webp / gif)

#### Web Workers

* Encoding Worker, with `msgpack`
* Compression Worker, with `pako`
* WebSocket Client Worker

#### MPEG DASH Loading Support

* `fugitive-dashjs`, using fugitive fetch

#### Visualizer / Playground

* Using uber's `deck.gl`
